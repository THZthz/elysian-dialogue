## PRINCIPLES

- If user's intention is ambiguous, be sure to ask first.
- Focus on **MODULARITY** and **EXTENSIBILITY**. Avoid type redefinition and magic strings. Do not let one file grows too big (>700 lines).
- If `// TODO:`, `// WARNING:` or `// NOTE:` is found in code, preserve it.
- No need to add license header for new files, user will add it manually.
- No need to consider backward compatibility, always start fresh.
- If you meet a problem regarding to Cypher usage in LadybugDB, check CYPHER.md in the project root.
- Always use `Bash` tool and bash scripts.

## IMPORTANT: Your workflow

1. **Read DEVELOPER.md BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE**. DEVELOPER.md may contain outdated information, so it should only act as a reference. Check the exact source files before you act.
2. Explore the codebase, making plans, modify codebase, etc.
3. Update DEVELOPER.md after you have modified the codebase, keep concise.
