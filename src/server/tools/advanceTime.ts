## Brief
Advance the in-game clock. Do not just narrate that time have passed without calling
\`${TOOL_NAMES.ADVANCE_TIME}\`. Use hours for sub-day advances, or days (0+) for multi-day travel.
Total advancement = days * 24 + hours. Always include a brief \`reason\` so your future self knows
why time moved.

## Inner details
When ${TOOL_NAMES.ADVANCE_TIME} is called, a new TimePoint will be created first, then TimeAnchor
will point to the new TimePoint: (TimeAnchor)-[:CURRENT_TIMEPOINT]->(TimePoint), finally the new
TimePoint will link to the old via NEXT_TIMEPOINT with the \`reason\` stored on the relationship.
