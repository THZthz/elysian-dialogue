## Brief
READ or WRITE the world archive using Cypher.

READ — MATCH...RETURN. The current scene is pre-loaded in SCENE_CONTEXT — don't
re-query that information. Use READ for: entities at other locations, message history,
TimePoint chain, or entity details not shown in the scene context. Auto-limited to 50 rows.

WRITE — CREATE, MERGE, SET, DELETE. The archive IS the world — if you don't WRITE it,
it didn't happen. Every world mutation you narrate MUST be persisted. Use MERGE for
upserts, SET for property updates, DETACH DELETE for removal. Must include WHERE when
deleting. Register new types via manageSchema before creating nodes/relationships with
new types in your Cypher.

Internal properties prefixed with "_" are hidden from READ results.

## Forbidden
- Do not call this tool multiple times when the queries are similar in structure, combine queries.
